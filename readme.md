# 🌾 FarmSage - AI Crop Recommendation System

FarmSage is a smart and intuitive crop prediction web application that recommends the most suitable crops based on soil nutrient levels, water content, temperature, and rainfall. Powered by machine learning (XGBoost) and built with a modern React frontend and Flask backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌿 Crop Prediction using real-world soil, climate, and organic input
- 🧠 Machine Learning Model trained with XGBoost for high accuracy
- ⚛️ Modern React Frontend with Material UI and responsive layout
- 🐍 Flask Backend API serving predictions via REST
- 🎨 Custom typography with Florisha and Boruna fonts
- 📦 Structured, maintainable, and easily deployable

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

| Frontend        | Backend        | ML Model     | Styling       |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| React + Vite   | Flask + Python | XGBoost      | Material UI + Custom Fonts |

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User inputs values for:
   - Macronutrients (N, P, K)
   - Secondary nutrients (S, Ca, Mg)
   - Micronutrients (Fe, Zn, etc.)
   - Climate & Soil: Water, Organic Matter, Temperature (°C), Rainfall (cm)

2. The Flask backend loads a trained `xgb_crop_model.pkl` model to compute the best crop(s).

3. Results are displayed instantly on the UI in a stylized card format.
